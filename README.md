# Aviation Risk Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes aviation accident data to identify aircraft manufacturers and characteristics associated with lower operational risk.

The analysis supports business decision-making for companies planning to invest in aircraft operations by evaluating accident frequency, fatalities, and damage severity.

## Business Objective
The goal of this project is to identify lower-risk aircraft options based on historical accident data to guide safer investment decisions in aviation operations.

## Dataset
The dataset contains aviation accident records including:
- Accident date
- Aircraft type
- Operator
- Fatalities
- Damage severity
- Location

The data was cleaned and analyzed using Python and Pandas.

## Key Questions Answered
1. Which aircraft manufacturers are involved in the most accidents?
2. Which manufacturers record the highest fatalities?
3. How does damage severity vary by manufacturer?

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Tableau Public
- Jupyter Notebook

## Tableau Dashboard
An interactive Tableau dashboard was created to visualize accident frequency, fatalities, and damage severity by aircraft manufacturer.

The dashboard allows stakeholders to explore aviation risk patterns and supports data-driven decision-making.

## Repository Contents
- Jupyter Notebook with analysis
- Cleaned dataset
- Executive summary presentation
- Tableau dashboard
- Project documentation

## Conclusion
The analysis indicates that certain manufacturers and aircraft categories demonstrate lower accident severity and fatalities, helping guide safer investment decisions.
